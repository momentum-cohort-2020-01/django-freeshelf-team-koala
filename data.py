        "description": """There is no book - there can be no book - that will infallibly point the way to successful bloodstock breeding. Yet in the General Stud Book, the sport of horse racing has produced a genetic record extending over more than two centuries and a score of generations that contains an ordered store of facts about the hereditary qualities of one living species - data that no scientific body possesses. Here is the recorded experience of the man who, above all others of our time, has deciphered the riddle of its manifold pages: Federico Tesio.""",

        "description": """Many farmers today are concerned, not only with the increasing cost of conventional drugs, but also with their side-effects and the build-up of resistant strains of bacteria due to the continued and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics. While this book will appeal to the already converted it is hoped that the unprejudiced newcomer will be sufficiently encouraged to investigate this system of medicine and enjoy its undoubted benefits. The aim of the homeopathic approach is to build up the health of the herd and increase the resistance of its individual members to disease, and, in consequence to increase the milk output and quality."""

There is much information in this book. It can be used as a reference for the key movements, ideas and people in the history of animal breeding.' -- Jennifer Adlem The British Journal for the History of Science vol 49:01:2016 'Masterminding Nature is an ambitious and a valuable contribution to the literature.' -- Rebecca J.H. Woods""",
        "description": """In Masterminding Nature, Margaret Derry examines the evolution of modern animal breeding from the invention of improved breeding methodologies in eighteenth-century England to the application of molecular genetics in the 1980s and 1990s. A clear and concise introduction to the science and practice of artificial selection, Derry's book puts the history of breeding in its scientific, commercial, and social context. Masterminding Nature explains why animal breeders continued to use eighteenth-century techniques well into the twentieth century, why the chicken industry was the first to use genetics in its breeding programs, and why it was the dairy cattle industry that embraced quantitative genetics and artificial insemination in the 1970s, as well as answering many other questions. Following the story right up to the present, the book concludes with an insightful analysis of today's complex relationships between biology, industry, and ethics."""

        "description": """The best-selling animal advocate Temple Grandin offers the most exciting exploration of how animals feel since The Hidden Life of Dogs. In her groundbreaking and best-selling book Animals in Translation, Temple Grandin drew on her own experience with autism as well as her distinguished career as an animal scientist to deliver extraordinary insights into how animals think, act, and feel. Now she builds on those insights to show us how to give our animals the best and happiest life--on their terms, not ours. It's usually easy to pinpoint the cause of physical pain in animals, but to know what is causing them emotional distress is much harder. Drawing on the latest research and her own work, Grandin identifies the core emotional needs of animals.""",

        "publish_date": "06 May 2014",
        "reviews": """Little noticed on the sidelines during the recent media controversy over Colorado's decision to legalize marijuana was a groundbreaking movement in Congress to lift a decades-long ban on the popular intoxicant's psychoactively inert cousin, hemp. As elucidated in this witty and informative overview of hemp's enormous agricultural potential, New Mexico-based author and radio reporter Fine argues that not much has ever made sense about the stigma U.S. lawmakers have heaped upon this incredibly versatile plant since it was made illegal back in 1937. Although it bears a strong resemblance to the smokable form of cannabis, hemp is almost completely lacking in THC, the ingredient that bestows marijuana's much sought-after 'high.' Hemp's incredibly strong internal fibers have been used in making everything from rope and paper to durable clothing and eco-friendly housing. In 11 engaging, myth-busting chapters bearing titles such as 'Grow Your Next Home' and 'Patriots Ponder Planting, ' Fine makes clear that hemp legalization, assuming it happens, could both boost the American economy and spawn a mini hemp based industrial revolution." "Doug Fine's engrossing and eye-opening book reveals hemp's role as a new source of food, energy, and raw materials. This absurd war on one of the world's most useful plants is about to end, and everyone can declare victory."--Mark Frauenfelder, founder, Boing Boing "I never dreamed industrial hemp had so much promise until I read Doug Fine's Hemp Bound. The book is not only fun to read, but it passes along fascinating insights about a farm crop that produces many food and fiber products and is adapted to areas where corn and soybeans are rarely profitable. As the author points out with gracious good humor, industrial hemp is not medical marijuana, and it should become a major farm crop in America as it has elsewhere."--Gene Logsdon, author of Gene Everlasting and Holy Shit: Managing Manure to Save Mankind "The issue is simple: farmers need hemp, the soil needs hemp, forests need hemp, and humanity needs the plant that the good Lord gave us for our own survival--hemp. The benefits are too many to name, but if hemp was a crop that could be monopolized by industrial Ag corporations it would already be legal. Hemp Bound tells us with detail and humor how to get to the environmental Promised Land. Doug has created a blueprint for the America of the future."--Willie Nelson Kirkus Reviews""",
        "description": """The stat sheet on hemp sounds almost too good to be true: its fibers are among the planet's strongest, its seed oil the most nutritious, and its potential as an energy source vast and untapped. Its one downside? For nearly a century, it's been illegal to grow industrial cannabis in the United States-even though Betsy Ross wove the nation's first flag out of hemp fabric, Thomas Jefferson composed the Declaration of Independence on it, and colonists could pay their taxes with it. But as the prohibition on hemp's psychoactive cousin winds down, one of humanity's longest-utilized plants is about to be reincorporated into the American economy. Get ready for the newest billion-dollar industry."""
